# House-Flipper

### How it started
Wanted to see if I could remake a game I liked while adding some changes to make it more fun

### How it went
Again, goals were a bit too big and then I went in a direction where I wanted to add a story to the game, that made me excited but then I realized how much work
would be required for a game I didn't really want to develop. I learned some cool things about generating structures though, the code there was interesting and
fun to make.
