# House-Flipper

### How it started
Wanted to see if I could remake a game I liked while adding some changes to make it more fun. This is [the second game I've tried developing](https://www.roblox.com/games/6537852940/House-Flipper-DEMO-WIP) on here and I feel
like I learned more than my first, but accomplished less as a product.

### How it went
Again, goals were a bit too big and then I went in a direction where I wanted to add a story to the game, that made me excited but then I realized how much work
would be required for a game I didn't really want to develop. I learned some cool things about generating structures though, the code there was interesting and
fun to make.

Currently you can buy a randomly generated house and refurbish it by cleaning trash out, retiling it, and scrubbing the dirty walls for profit. You can also buy a
pre-built house, which was supposed to introduce the story. Try walking into the bathroom after buying it and you'll see what I mean :)
